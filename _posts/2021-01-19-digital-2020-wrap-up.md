Shocking and challenging—these are the words that best describe the year 2020. Shocking mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other tumultuous social events; challenging in financial, physical, and psycho-social aspects of our lives. And some of us were able to deal with these challenges by improving our social bonds with our mutually “lock-down-ed” friends via the internet and social media. Indeed, it is undeniable that the technologies of the digital age have helped us cope with this struggling year, one way or another. But is everything that is digital automatically produce beneficial effects to us and to society? To balance things out, here is a year-review of the internet, social media, and other digital-related issues that plagued the Philippines and Filipinos for the year 2020.

![Arrest for government-critical social media posts](/assets/img/digital-2020-2.png "Amidst the fear from the strict implementation of lockdown rules and regulations, Filipinos became more worried about their safety because of the series of arrests merely because of social media posts criticizing President Rodrigo Duterte and Senator Bong Go during the first few months of nationwide lockdown.")

![Anti-Terror Law](/assets/img/digital-2020-5.png "Despite how well-intended it may sound, the Anti-Terror Law (ATL) grants the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) the power to arrest, detain, and prosecute individuals or organizations that may be deemed as \“terrorists\” without any court trial. The controversial law sparked outrage online when the military stated that ATL would be used \“to regulate social media\” although the Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Delfin Lorenzana rejected this claim as it impedes the freedom of speech and discourse. Even without their hands-on social media platforms, the ATL still aggravates the worsening atmosphere of institutionalized \“red-tagging\” in the Philippines.")

![Cloned Facebook accounts](/assets/img/digital-2020-6.png "Several duplicate Facebook accounts with names of activists, those critical to the government, and later on, those who do not have any social media accounts, have emerged in the early weeks of July. Some of the duplicated accounts went to the extreme and inflicted online harassment and sent death threats to the original accounts. Although Facebook did not have an official statement regarding this incident, it undeniably exacerbated the fear already caused by the then newly enacted Anti-Terror Law.")

![DOH leak](/assets/img/digital-2020-7.png "People are hesitant to undergo swab tests as turning out COVID-19 positive will not only affect their livelihood, but also their psycho-social aspect due to harmful stigma. With all its dire consequences, the uproar caused by the data leak of suspected COVID-19 patients which fundamentally violated their privacy rights is beyond understandable.")

![Rise of online platforms amid the pandemic](/assets/img/digital-2020-8.png "Online shopping platforms/applications such as Shopee and Lazada offered a market alternative to stores and malls that were unavailable due to lockdown. It is no surprise then that throughout 2020, there has been a surge of usage of online shopping applications and other related platforms as they serve as a convenient and virus-safe alternative.")

![Facebook takes down network of fake accounts linked to AFP, PNP](/assets/img/digital-2020-9.png "Hundreds of Facebook accounts linked to users China have been taken down by Facebook due to “coordinated inauthentic behavior” or interference in local politics of a country—in this case, in the Philippines and the United States. Coming from two distinct networks based in China with a reach of about 280,000 people, the pages post about domestic politics, anti-terror moves by the military, criticism of the opposition, youth activists and organizations, and the CPP-NPA and NDFP.")

![Fake news](/assets/img/digital-2020-9-2.png "Fake news has been a common sight in social media pages for the past few years. Aside from their inherent nature to mislead readers and audience from the truth to give way to their own propaganda, in a worst-case scenario, fake news can also become life-threatening. What is even worse is when a government institution itself is the one peddling these kinds of fake news.")

![Online learning and digital divide](/assets/img/digital-2020-10.png "The digital divide in the Philippines became more prominent in the official opening of online classes in October 2020. Although some students were able to join and adapt, others were facing technical difficulties due to unreliable internet connection and even suffered psychological distress because of this new classroom set-up and materials. In extreme cases, some students were selling sexually explicit materials in order to afford online learning, while others were completely left behind and were unable to enroll.")

![PhilSys pre-registration](/assets/img/digital-2020-11.png "PhilSys, Philippine National ID
The newly proposed national ID system of the Philippines named PhilSys, will not only create a unified ID system, but will also increase the efficiency of gathering and storing citizen’s data and improve its services, especially the financial distribution. Although it will give tons of benefits, challenges in logistics and its data security capability are still plaguing its actual implementation.")

![Surge in Online Delivery Services and Related Labor Issues](/assets/img/digital-2020-12.png "Despite being a fundamental aspect of the digital economy, delivery riders often experience the bad receiving end—either from customers or the company itself. In November 2020, approximately 100 Foodpanda drivers went to strike to protest the allegedly exploitative labor practices of the company.")
